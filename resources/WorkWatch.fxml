  A fxml file defines a node graph that can be loaded and rendered by an javafx application.
  A node is a gui element that can be either a branch/parent or a leaf/child.
  A branch can contain branches and/or leaves.
  This way a graph is build.

  HBox a branch node, lays out child nodes horizontally.
  An instance of the HBox class will be created and can be loaded by the FXMLLoader.
  The xmlns:fx namespace is required (and must be fx) to use fxml attributes.
  fx:controller defines the class that will be used to bind nodes with.
